Calculate Big O For Unscramble Computer Science Problems.

Task0:
This task will take a Constant Time of O(1).
Thus No matter the size of the input data, the running time will always be the same.

Task1:
This task will take linear time i.e., O(n). I have a function that has a set which takes a Constant Time of O(1), and 2 for loops each => O(n)

Task2:
This task will take linear time i.e., O(n). The for loop takes a linear time O(n), while max items in list takes O(n)

Task3:
This task is divided into two parts:
Part A total time complexity is O(n log n).
Part B total time complexity is O(n)

Task4:
This task will take time complexity of O(n log n)
